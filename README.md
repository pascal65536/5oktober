`pip install behoof`

This Python project to be a versatile utility library offering a wide range of functionalities, including:

1. String and Text Manipulation:

   - vowel, consonant, rus_alphabet, transliteration, is_palindrome - Functions related to character analysis, alphabet manipulation, and palindrome detection.

   - generate_alternating_name, generate_fake_name - Functions for generating names, potentially for testing or data generation purposes.

2. Mathematical Operations:

   - is_prime, get_divisors, gcd, lcm - Functions for prime number detection, divisor finding, and calculation of greatest common divisor and least common multiple.

   - euclidean_distance - Functions for calculates the Euclidean distance between two points given as tuples of two numbers (e.g. (x, y)).

3. Data Handling and I/O:

   - generate_name, name_to_hex_color, load_json, save_json, upload_file - Functions for color generation, JSON file handling, and file uploading.

   - logging_to_csv - Function for logging messages to a CSV file.

4. Text Similarity and Distance:

   - hamming_distance, similarity, calculate_jaccard_similarity - Functions for calculating text similarity and distance metrics.

5. File Management and Manipulation:

   - collect_files_lst, moves_file, generate_random_code_string - Functions for collecting files, moving files, and generating random code strings.

   - calculate_md5, str_to_md5, calculate_sha256, str_to_sha256, find_duplicate_files, delete_files, remove_empty_directories, move_file_to_folder_with_limit - Functions specifically focused on duplicate file management, including MD5 (SHA256) hashing, duplicate file detection, deletion, and organization into folders with limited file counts.
